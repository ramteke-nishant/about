            <h2>How I Built a Website for Just ₹99 While Searching for an IT Job</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Nishant Ramteke from Nagpur. Born in 1995, I graduated with a degree in Information Technology Engineering. Today, I want to share my journey of building a website for just ₹99 while I was on the hunt for a job as a System Administrator, despite having no prior experience in HTML or website building.</p>

	<section class="section">
            <h3>The Beginning of My Journey</h3>
            <p>As a fresh graduate eager to dive into the IT world, I knew having a personal website would boost my chances of landing a job. However, my budget was tight, and my knowledge of website creation was minimal. Determined to overcome these obstacles, I embarked on a mission to build my own website from scratch.</p>

	<section class="section">
            <h3>Step 1: Leveraging Online Resources</h3>
            <p>My first step was to explore online resources to learn the basics of website building. I stumbled upon <a href="https://chatgpt.com">chatgpt.com</a>, which became an invaluable guide. The platform's conversational AI helped me understand fundamental concepts and provided step-by-step instructions on creating a website.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Setting Up a GitHub Repository</h3>
            <p>Next, I created a GitHub account. <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a> offered free hosting for static websites through GitHub Pages. I learned to set up a repository and push my first HTML files, thanks to the detailed guides and community support available on the site.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Finding an Affordable Hosting Service</h3>
            <p>Although GitHub Pages was a great start, I wanted a more professional look for my website. I discovered <a href="https://www.hostinger.com">Hostinger.com</a>, which offered affordable hosting plans. With a minimal investment of ₹99, I purchased a basic hosting plan and a domain name, giving my website a more polished appearance.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Enhancing Website Security</h3>
            <p>To ensure my website was secure and loaded quickly, I integrated <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare.com</a>. Cloudflare provided a free plan that included a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and SSL certificate, enhancing both the performance and security of my site.</p>

	<section class="section">
            <h3>The Final Product</h3>
            <p>After a few weeks of learning, coding, and integrating various services, my website was finally live. It showcased my resume, projects, and a blog where I shared my IT journey and insights. This not only demonstrated my technical skills but also my ability to learn and adapt quickly-key traits for a System Administrator.</p>
